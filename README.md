- [**HTML**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic building blocks for web pages, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML forms the backbone of any web document and is essential for web development.

- [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. It allows developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to HTML elements. CSS enhances the visual appeal and user experience of a website by enabling the separation of content and design.

- [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a versatile programming language that enables interactive and dynamic functionality on web pages. It allows developers to create features like form validation, animations, and asynchronous content loading. JavaScript is essential for building modern web applications and works seamlessly with HTML and CSS to create a complete user experience.

- [**Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins. It helps developers write more maintainable and reusable stylesheets by allowing advanced functionalities such as inheritance and modularization.

- [**ScrollReveal.js**](https://scrollrevealjs.org/guide/installation.html) is a JavaScript library used to create animated scroll-based reveal effects on web pages. It enables animations that trigger when elements come into view as the user scrolls, enhancing visual engagement and dynamism.

- [**Swiper.js**](https://swiperjs.com/get-started) is a modern JavaScript library for creating touch sliders with smooth transitions. It offers features like infinite looping, autoplay, and various navigation controls, making it ideal for interactive carousels and sliders with touch and gesture support.

- [**MixItUp**](https://github.com/patrickkunka/mixitup/) is a JavaScript library for creating animated filtering, sorting, and grouping of content on web pages. It allows developers to build interactive and dynamic layouts, such as portfolios or galleries, with smooth animations and responsive design.
